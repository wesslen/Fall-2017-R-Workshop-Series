<h1 class="title">R Workshop Series</h1>

R has become a vital tool for statisticians, data scientists and (now) computational social scientists. 

In this ten part series, I'll cover critical R skills for social scientists including data acquisition, visualizations, machine learning, social network and text analysis.

Each workshop is open to UNCC graduate students, staff and faculty. To register, please sign up for each workshop at [this link](https://projectmosaic.uncc.edu/events-list/).

Participants new to R should attend the first three workshops that cover essential R skills.

Participants should bring their own laptops (if you want to run the code) with R/R Studio installed. See instructions below for details on how to get R/R Studio on your laptop.

We're working on redesigning the Project Mosaic consultation reservation website 

# Series structure

Each session is divided into three sections: 

1. An introduction to R (basic skills, dataframes, tidyverse)

2. Intermediate R skills (RMarkdown, Git, Visualizations, APIs)

3. Computational social science tools (social network, machine learning and text) 

Each workshop is standalone -- so participants aren't required to come to all although each workshop will build off the skills from previous workshops.

Participants in the later workshops are **strongly** encouraged to review materials from at least the first three workshops.

# Prerequisites

The first session assumes no knowledge of R or programming skills. 

Later sessions will assume knowledge of materials from the first three workshops as well as probability, basic statistics and linear regression. 

# Software 

This course will use [R](https://www.r-project.org/), which is a free and open-source programming language primarily used for statistics and data analysis. 

We will also use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which is an easy-to-use interface GUI for R. 

**Easiest Approach: Install Locally**

Simply go to both links and download the latest versions of R and R Studio locally. 

**Alternative: Docker**

Alternatively, you can use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) either locally ([Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac) or [Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows)) or using a temporary instance at [play-with-docker.com](http://labs.play-with-docker.com/).

* Once you have docker installed, run "docker run -d -p 8787:8787 rocker/tidyverse". After the image download is complete, go to [http://localhost#8787](http://localhost#8787) link to open the browser. 

* If you're using "play-with-docker", you can open the browser by clicking the "8787" button that will appear near your IP. After clicking the link, go back to your terminal and copy your token (see the terminal) and press ok.

* In your browser session, use the username/pwd rstudio/rstudio to open R Studio. 

For Python users more use to Jupyter notebooks, see this [Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/datascience-notebook/). There are other alternatives so don't feel obligated to use this Docker Hub.
